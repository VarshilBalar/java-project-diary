            <h1>Plan GeNow</h1>
            <h2>Time Tracking made simple</h2>
            <p>We are a student of OTH Amberg currently in the 1st semester (Msc. in Artificial Intelligence for Industrial Applications) working together
                on a project to build our own software to track our progress through the project. Basically,
             it's a project diary. We have given it a name 'Plan GeNow' which basically means to execute the
             plan right now and GeNow being a play between the german word 'Genau' and the English word 'Now'.
             In this section, you will see a brief introduction about who we are and what we believe in. Also, special thanks to
             our supervisor Prof. Dr. Sandra Rebholz for giving us an opportunity to develop our skills and understanding
             of software development through this project. We would also like to thank her for providing us with such a great
             team with equal motivation and dedication towards the project. The memories and friendship made along the
             way will never be forgotten.   </p>

                <p>Plan GeNow is an innovative software tool developed by OTH Amberg students for efficient project management and time tracking. It integrates seamlessly into daily workflows, allowing users to log activities, set milestones, and monitor deadlines effortlessly.<br>
    
                <p>The software's intuitive interface features visual progress reports that highlight project status and potential delays. This enables users to manage their projects with precision, making adjustments as needed to stay on track.</p>
                    
                <p>"Plan GeNow" combines the German 'Genau' (precisely) with the English 'Now', reflecting its focus on immediate and accurate project execution. The tool is designed to be a central hub for all project-related tasks, enhancing productivity.</p>
                    
                <p>Under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Sandra Rebholz, the student team not only developed the software but also learned valuable skills in collaboration and time management. Their diverse technical backgrounds contributed to a rich development process. </p>
                    
                <p>Looking forward, the team aims to expand Plan GeNow’s capabilities, including AI-driven features for predicting project timelines. They seek to make the tool accessible to a broader audience, enhancing project management across various sectors.</p>
                    
                <p>GeNow exemplifies how student innovation can lead to practical solutions in the workplace, demonstrating the real-world applications of artificial intelligence in streamlining project management.</p>
