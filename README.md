# Project Activity Tracker: Time and Activity Management Software<br>

## Overview<br>
The **Project Activity Tracker** is a software application developed to track project activities and the time spent on them.<br>
It allows individual team members to log activities, track the time spent on each, and organize projects in iterations.<br>
Additionally, the application provides analysis features to evaluate time spent on various activities with respect to different criteria.<br>

## Main Features<br>
1. **Project Management**: Create, edit, and delete projects.<br>
2. **Activity Categories**: Configure hierarchically organized activity categories for each project.<br>
3. **Project Iterations**: Organize each project into iterations.<br>
4. **Activity Tracking**: Add, edit, and delete activities.<br>
5. **Time Tracking**: Track time spent on individual activities.<br>
6. **Personal Records**: Record personal objectives, challenges, and solutions related to assigned activities.<br>
7. **Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize the logged activities to determine time spent per activity category, iteration, or overall project.<br>
8. **Export Functionality**: Export the recorded activities and data for further analysis or reporting.<br>

## Tools and Resources<br>
- **Java**: Programming language used for building the software.<br>
- **JSP & Servlets**: For creating dynamic web pages and handling business logic.<br>
- **MySQL**: For storing project and activity data.<br>
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building an interactive and user-friendly UI.<br>

## Setup Instructions<br>
1. **Clone the Repository**:<br>
   ```bash<br>
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-activity-tracker.git<br>
   cd project-activity-tracker<br>
   ```<br>
2. **Set up the Database**:<br>
   - Create a MySQL database named `project_tracker`.<br>
   - Run the necessary SQL scripts to set up tables for projects, activities, and logs.<br>
3. **Run the Application**:<br>
   - Set up the application server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).<br>
   - Deploy the project in the server and access it via a web browser.<br>

## Implementation Details<br>
### Project Management<br>
- **Create Projects**: Users can create new projects by specifying a title, description, and start date.<br>
- **Edit Projects**: Modify project details including title, description, and progress.<br>
- **Delete Projects**: Projects can be deleted, and all associated data is removed.<br>

### Activity Categories<br>
- Configure activity categories in a hierarchical structure.<br>
- Each project can have multiple categories and subcategories.<br>

### Activity Tracking and Time Recording<br>
- Add activities to each project.<br>
- For each activity, users can log time spent and specify objectives, challenges, and solutions.<br>

### Analysis and Visualization<br>
- The application provides charts and graphs to visualize time distribution by category, iteration, or overall project.<br>
- Users can filter data by activity type or iteration to get meaningful insights.<br>

### Exporting Data<br>
- Export activity logs and analysis results in formats such as CSV or PDF for further use or reporting.<br>
